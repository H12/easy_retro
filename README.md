# EasyRetro

This is a simple, real-time retro board built with Phoenix LiveView and OTP.

## Getting Started

This is a Phoenix LiveView project. If you've never worked with Elixir or Phoenix, the Elixir and Phoenix docs provide good instructions on how to install the necessary dependences:

* https://elixir-lang.org/install.html
* https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content

If you use `asdf` for version management, you can also install Elixir via the [official plugin](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir).

### Requirements

- Erlang `23.0.x`
- Elixir `1.11.x`
- Phoenix `1.5.x`
- NodeJS `12.x.x`

### Commands

#### `mix setup`

#### `iex -S mix`

#### `mix format`

#### `MIX_ENV=test mix test`

### Hooray!

You sould now be able to run `mix phx.server` and view EasyRetro at [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
